title: SevenPoints Blog Up and Running on Github Pages & Jekyll!!
---

After just a few minutes of work, we now have our blog up and running thanks to the very helpful blog article from [Barry Clark](http://www.barryclark.co/introducing-jekyll-now/)

I just discovered the wonders of [static sites](http://www.staticapps.org/articles/defining-static-web-apps) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) this weekend and decided to go ahead and spin up a static blog site on our github account.  We'll use this site to write helpful articles for our employees and customers.

Stay tuned for more to come!
